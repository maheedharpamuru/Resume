### Experience
**Microsoft, Redmond,WA (July 2017 - Present)**
**Position:** Software Development Engineer Intern <br/>
**Project:** ESIntellect<br/>
* Goal of ESIntellect project is to analyze historical test results using different machine learning approaches, generate machine learning models, and develop service APIs for clients to calculate effectiveness of new builds using the generated model.
* Analyzed test results generated every day on the huge variety of hardware that runs some variant of Windows (Tablets, Servers, Xboxes, hololens, …)
* Identified user patterns from  historical data using different clustering and classfication ML algorithms, analyzed accuracy of each model and fine tuned parameters for better performance.
* Designed and Developed backend prototype service which enables the customers to makes decisions more clearer/cleaner and can eventually help auto ri when  signals are all clear. 
* This service helps to reduce the unreliable test cases, failures produces (aka noise), reduces machine hours wastage.

**Project:**  Interview and Interviewee apps <br/>
* Part of leap team developed interview and interviewee apps using sharepoint and MVC framework. Earlier, LEAP cohort interview scheduling is cumbersome approach for PM. This app helps to reduce the PM effort and smoothen the scheduling process more efficiently and organized. 

**Microsoft Professional Data Scientist Program, Redmond, WA (February 2017 – April 2017)**
*	The coursework contained modules to develop skills in data manipulation using T-SQL and visualization using Excel, Power BI, and Python.
*	Covered fundamentals of Data Science Essential, principles of Machine Learning and Statistics.
*	Built data model in Power BI in star schema and built dashboards which contained pivot table, pivot charts, trending charts, pie charts based on the model.
*	Built model using classification algorithm to predict if new customer will buy a bike and regression algorithm to find average monthly income spent of new customer from data collected by Adventure Works Cycles company using Azure ML and Cortana Intelligence suite.

**Orora Design Technologies, Bellevue (Dec 2014 – Jan 2016)**  
**Position:** Application Engineer<br/>
**Project:** Arana Behavioral Modeling Platform<br/>
Arana Platform automates the process of behavioural model creation, generation, optimization, and validation for analog, custom digital, memory and mixed-signal integrated circuits<br/>
**Role**
*	Developed back-end service component using Java.
* Designed different analog circuits and verified functionality using Arana platform.
* Verified the  functionality of analog circuits using verilogA behavioural modelling.
*	Arana platform reduces the skilled manpower by 75%.<br/>

**Silicon Image Inc, India(Feb 2010-June 2014)**  
**Position:** Sr Analog Mixed Signal Design Engineer<br/>
**Project:** HDMI and MHL<br/>
HDMI is an interface for transmitting uncompressed video data and compressed or uncompressed digital audio data from a HDMI-compliant source device, such as a display controller, to a compatible computer monitor, video projector, digital television, or digital audio device.<br/>
**Role:** 
* Designed different analog circuits in different technology nodes with different foundries.<br/>
